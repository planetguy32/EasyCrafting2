#Turbo Crafting Table
[EasyCrafting by Lepko](minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/224295-easycrafting) is a very nice addition to Minecraft, especially when playing with mods that add lengthy crafting trees. The only downside is that it makes you craft a separate block. Wouldn't it be awesome to have the same capability available standard in crafting tables?

Turbo Crafting Table wil replace the vanilla crafting table GUI with a more versatile version, with one tab showing the Crafting Table II-style interface derived from EasyCrafting, and the other with the familiar vanilla 3x3 crafting grid for recipes that it can't automatically understand.

Modifying the vanilla table instead of adding a block lets Turbo Crafting Table be client-side-only - if you want to use it in an existing pack or server, the modpack doesn't need to add it.
